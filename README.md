# legacy-tripservice-kata
Initial code base related for http://craftedsw.blogspot.com/2011/07/testing-legacy-hard-wired-dependencies.html

According to the initial description, there are only two rules
1. We can't change any existing code if not covered by tests.
2. There is one exception: We are allowed to use automated refactorings (via IDE) to refactor for writing unit tests.
